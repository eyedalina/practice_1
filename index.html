    <h2 id="about">About</h2>
    <p><strong>Manovich was born in Moscow, USSR, where he studied painting, architecture, computer science, 
        and semiotics. After spending several years practicing fine arts, he moved to New York in 1981. 
        His interests shifted from still image and physical 3D space to virtual space, moving images, and the 
        use of computers in media. While in New York he received an M.A. in Experimental Psychology (NYU, 1988) 
        and additionally worked professionally in 3D computer animation from 1984 to 1992. He then went on to 
        receive a Ph.D. in Visual and Cultural Studies from the University of Rochester in 1993 under the supervision 
        of Mieke Bal. His Ph.D. dissertation The Engineering of Vision from Constructivism to Computers traces the origins 
        of computer media, relating it to the avant-garde of the 1920s.

    <p><strong>Manovich has taught new media art since 1992. He has also been a visiting professor at California Institute of the Arts, 
        UCLA, University of Amsterdam, Stockholm University, and University of Art and Design Helsinki. In 1993, students of his digital 
        movie making classes at the UCLA Lab for New Media founded the Post-Cinematic Society which organized some of the first digital 
        movie festivals based on his ideas about new media such as database cinema.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>In 2007 Manovich founded the research lab Software Studies Initiative, which was subsequently renamed as the Cultural Analytics Lab in 2016.

    <h2 id="newmedia">The Language of New Media</h2>
    <p><strong>His book, The Language of New Media (2001), covers many aspects of cultural software: 
        for example, he identifies a number of key tools or processes (he calls them 'operations') 
        that underpin commercial software from word processing to video editing programs. 
        These include the conventions of 'cut and paste' copy, find, delete, transform, etc. 
        The extracts we have chosen highlight significant 'new' aspects of the new media Manovich is 
        concerned with. He is often concerned with visual culture and especially with moving image, 
        so the first sections, 'The Database' and 'Database and Algorithm', explore something of the 
        distinct ways in which computers store and manipulate information (here, for example, moving image footage). 
        He compares this with traditional techniques of manipulating and editing film stock. The 'Navigable Space' 
        extract is also concerned with the moving image, but this is the moving image as a mapping or modeling of 
        virtual space. From architectural 'fly-throughs' to the visceral and violent pleasures of exploring the corridors 
        of the videogame Doom, virtual space is discussed as a significant new cultural form that draws on pre-digital visual and cinematic culture.

    <h2 id="softcinema">Soft cinema</h2>
    <p><strong>His digital art project Soft Cinema was commissioned by ZKM for the exhibition Future Cinema (2002â€“03); 
        traveling to Helsinki, Finland, and Tokyo, Japan, in April 2003. "Although the films resemble the familiar genres of cinema, 
        the process by which they were created demonstrates the possibilities of soft(ware) cinema. A "cinema," that is, in which human 
        subjectivity and the variable choices made by custom software combine to create films that can run infinitely without ever exactly 
        repeating the same image sequences, screen layouts and narratives. Each Soft Cinema run offers a unique viewing experience for 
        the audience; the software works with a set of parameters that allow for almost every part of a film to change.
    </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Soft Cinema projects mine the creative possibilities that exist at the intersection of software culture, cinema, and architecture. 
        Its manifestations include films, dynamic visualization, computer-driven installations, architectural designs, print catalogs, and DVDS.
